# Predicting variables along glider tracks that are only measured by Argo floats

As part of this project we use random forest to predict variables along the high resolution path of gliders, which are only measured by Argo floats in the region. 

This is part of the SOGOS project where a SOCCOM BGC Argo Float was deployed along with two sea gliders. The goal was to use the gliders (~6-10 profiles per day) to learn about the small scale structures in the tracer fields, and what their implications might be for ocean ventilation.
