## Notes about Argo floats in the region

The Argo floats measure in-situ temperature and practical salinity. 

Here is a list of floats in our region that have good pH/pCO2/DIC data:
- 886
- 9096
- 9260
- 9657
- 12575
- 12742
- 12880
- 12882
- 12885

Alkalinity is not a measured variable, but instead predicted ([Carter et al 2018](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lom3.10232)). LIARv2 works with 16 different combinations of the predictor variables: salinity S, potential temperature Î¸, nitrate N, apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and silicate (Si), and the MLR is done over regions of approx 500X500km.

Check out using AOU instead of O2, and spice and density instead of T and S.
